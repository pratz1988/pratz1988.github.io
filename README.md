# Pratz's memory game 

I built this memory game as part of my GA ( General Assembely ) SEI bootcamp. The objective of the project was to demonstrate the java script / html / css knowledge by buidling a fully functional applicaiton. You match two cards at a time and once all the cards are matched you win the game. 


# Setup / Installation

Clone this git repo to get the source code behind git. Loax index.htm and play the game.
All the JS, CSS files are self explanatory and the game should work after you copy over the files to a locaiton.

# How to Play

The end goal of the game is to match all the cards in pairs and win the game.

 - First you select the grid size ( 2x2, 3x3, 4x4 )
 - Start the game by clicking two cards - if the cards are a perfect match they will stay in the flipped stage. If they are not, they will flip back.
 - Keep looking for matched cards
 - When you finish matching allt he cards, you get a message 'You Win!!'
 - rinse and repeat


# Tech behind this
The app is built in javascript - it uses Jquery and some standard CSS. For getitng the images, I am using a standard API ( < insert API source here > )
